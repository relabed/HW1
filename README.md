Multiply two square matrix using langage C with Eclipse IDE 202-12 in sequential mode & parallel mode (with pthread)


This is what we do in this homework :

- a Makefile has been defined.
- User has to input the dimension of the matrix
- Sequential version of mmm
- Parallel version of mmm
- We verify that parallel version is correct by comparing the result matrix with
one generated using the sequential algorithm.
- we have timed the execution time and we display the result in seconds
- A README is written.
- We have commenting the programs
